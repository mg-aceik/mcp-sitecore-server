/**
 * Turns a failed SPE response into a message that says what actually answered.
 *
 * `response.statusText` alone is actively misleading here. A CM whose login is federated
 * to Sitecore Cloud does not reject an unauthenticated remoting call with 403: it redirects
 * to the identity provider, which replies with its own HTML error page and a 400 — so the
 * only thing the caller ever saw was "Bad Request", and the 3KB body naming the real
 * problem was thrown away. That one omission is enough to send someone diagnosing this
 * after a disabled `remoting` service, which is not what is wrong.
 *
 * So: keep the status, name the responder when a known one is identifiable from the
 * headers, and carry an excerpt of the body. HTML is stripped to its visible text, because
 * an error page's markup is noise and its wording is the entire point.
